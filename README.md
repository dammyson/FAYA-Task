# FAYA-Task
Create a simple web-app, host on a url we can visit (I recommend free heroku or something similar) ● Users can enter a URL of a page to fetch ● The web app fetches the HTML of the page and displays the source to the user ● A summary of the document is displayed, listing which tags are present in the HTML and how many of each tag ● Clicking on the name of each tag in the summary will highlight the tags in the source code view
